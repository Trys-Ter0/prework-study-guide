# prework-study-guide
This Study Guide was created for bootcamp students who were going through the Prework. It contains  noted on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.

I made this study guide in order to inform new students about their course prework.

It helps students navigate the material. I revised the basics of putting together a website and learnt about the importance of using Github and managing version control.
